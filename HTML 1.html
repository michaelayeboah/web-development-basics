		<h1>The Internet</h1>
		<hr>

        <h2><b>What is the internet?</b></h2>
        <p>The Internet is a <b>global network</b> of computers connected to each other that allows the sharing of information and communication. It connects millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks using standardized communication protocols.</p>

        <h2><b>How does the internet work?</b></h2>
        <p>The Internet works by transferring data through a system of <i>routers</i>, <i>servers</i>, and <i>devices</i> using the <b>Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)</b>. When you send or request information online, your device breaks it into small pieces called <i>packets</i>, which travel through different networks and are reassembled when they reach their destination.</p>

        <h2><b>What is a Domain Name?</b></h2>
        <p>A domain name is the <i>human-readable address</i> of a website — like <i>www.google.com</i> — that makes it easier to access instead of using the site’s numeric <i>IP address</i> (e.g., 142.250.190.78). Domain names are managed through registrars and organized under extensions like:
        <ol>
            <li>.com</li>
            <li>.org</li>
            <li>.edu</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <h2><b>DNS and How it Works</b></h2>
        <p><b>DNS (Domain Name System)</b> is like the phonebook of the Internet. It translates <i>domain names</i> (like <i>www.knust.edu.gh</i>) into <i>IP addresses</i> (like <i>192.168.1.1</i>), which computers use to identify each other. When you type a website name, your browser asks a DNS server to find the matching IP address so it can load the correct website.</p>

        <h2><b>Browsers and How They Work</b></h2>
        <p>A <i>web browser</i> (like Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Edge) is software that allows you to access and view websites. Browsers take the code of a webpage — written in <i>HTML</i>, <i>CSS</i>, and <i>JavaScript</i> — and render it visually on your screen. They use an internal component called a <i>rendering engine</i> to interpret the code and display it as text, images, and interactive elements.</p>

        <h2><b>What are Markup Languages?</b></h2>
        <p><b>Markup languages</b> are systems used to structure and format content on web pages. They use <i>tags</i> to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. The most common markup language is <b>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</b>, which is the backbone of all web pages.</p>

        <h2><b>What is Front-End Development?</b></h2>
        <p><b>Front-end development</b> involves building the <i>user interface (UI)</i> and <i>user experience (UX)</i> of websites — the part that users see and interact with. It includes:
        <ul>
            <li><b>HTML</b> for structure</li>
            <li><b>CSS</b> for styling</li>
            <li><b>JavaScript</b> for interactivity</li>
        </ul>
        Front-end developers ensure websites look good and function smoothly across devices.</p>

        <h2><b>What is HTTP?</b></h2>
        <p><b>HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)</b> is the communication protocol used to transfer data between a web browser and a web server. When you enter a web address, the browser sends an <i>HTTP request</i> to the server, and the server sends back an <i>HTTP response</i> (usually an HTML document). A more secure version is <i>HTTPS</i>, which encrypts data for privacy and protection.</p>

        <h2><b>What is a Browser?</b></h2>
        <p>A <b>browser</b> is an application that enables users to search, retrieve, and view information from the web. Popular browsers include:
        <ul>
            <li>Google Chrome</li>
            <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
            <li>Microsoft Edge</li>
            <li>Safari</li>
            <li>Opera</li>
        </ul>
        They all interpret web code and make it visually accessible.</p>

        <h2><b>How do Browsers Work?</b></h2>
        <p>Browsers work through the following process:
        <ol>
            <li>You enter a URL or search query.</li>
            <li>The browser sends an <i>HTTP/HTTPS request</i> to the web server.</li>
            <li>The server responds with the website’s code.</li>
            <li>The browser’s <i>rendering engine</i> (like Blink or Gecko) processes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
            <li>It displays the final webpage for you to view and interact with.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <h2><b>How does the Web Work?</b></h2>
        <p>The <b>World Wide Web (WWW)</b> is a collection of information and resources connected through the Internet. It works through three main components:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Web Servers:</b> Store and send website files.</li>
            <li><b>Web Browsers:</b> Request and display those files.</li>
            <li><b>HTTP/HTTPS Protocols:</b> Facilitate communication between browsers and servers.</li>
        </ul>
        When you visit a website, your browser communicates with a web server using HTTP, receives HTML content, and displays it as a web page.</p>
